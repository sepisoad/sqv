## Features
- Portable: Runs on all major desktop operating systems.
- Self-contained: Comes with all necessary dependencies as source filesâ€”no need to install external packages.
- Written in pure `C`, utilizing `sokol` for window creation and graphics.

## Status
SQV is still in early development, but I have some exciting ideas for its future evolution.

## Building
To build SQV, you need [`premake5`](https://premake.github.io/) installed on your system.

1. Generate the Makefiles:
   ```sh
   premake5 gmake2
   ```

2. Build the source code
   ```sh
   make
   ```
